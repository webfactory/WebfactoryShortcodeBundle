## [Unreleased 2.0]

### Removed

- The current request will no longer be passed to controllers generating the shortcode substitution (see #15). For shortcodes being handled `inline`, use the `RequestStack` directly in the substituting controller method to obtain the parent request. For `esi`-based renderers, there is no current solution provided by this bundle (see #14). Check your shortcode controllers for access to the request attribute named `request` to find affected places.

### Changed

- Logging will now by default be directed to the `shortcode` channel, instead of the `app` channel used previously.
- Slightly reduced the logging level in `EmbeddedShortcodeHandler`.
